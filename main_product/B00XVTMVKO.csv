2,AEBCZA5VWFA27656JQCX5P3COHTA,True,Will fit a ladies larger foot only not a man's large foot!,OK so I knew what I was purchasing because I had purchased these exact socks twice before at a bargin basement store. So what I have to say is I am a ladies size 9 shoe and these JUST fit my foot with no room for anymore stretch and they shrink even more after washing. So men beware if you have a large foot these will not fit you. For the price they are worth the money and and on a scale of 1-10 (10 being very warm) they are about a 5 on the warmth scale. All-in-all I would recommend If you are a guy and have small size feet then I say go for it but no way if you have large feet. Ladies yes go for it if you are a size 9 or smaller..
