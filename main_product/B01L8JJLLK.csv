0,AETECYTNL2LOSCIELQDIQV63CGMQ,True,Perfect Sweater,"I bought a 2XL so that I could wear it as a dress (I'm 5'5 105 pounds) and it goes to the perfect length on me - Just slightly above my middle finger when my arms are down at my side.

1,AGDINU6V47MQTKNHEWICRG2NIEPA,True,Really Great for Those on a Budget,"I bought this shirt to wear under my hoodie for the upcoming cold Canadian Winter, and it's quite nice. The color is authentic to whichever you select, in my case it was dark green because I enjoy looking like a pre-ripened olive. I put it through the washer and dryer on high before putting it on, and it fits well. There is Elastic on the Wrists and Waist, and I think that is quite important if you're trying to keep the cold out. It is a bit thin for a sweater by my standards, but it's not meant to be a heavy sweater. Combine with other Hanes sweaters and hoodies like I did, and you can make a Super Sweater!

If you want the casual/wear-with-leggings/boyfriend sweater fit then consider sizing up. I bought M in this sweater just because of my preference but I got other colours in size L and the difference in fit isn't massive - mostly length. Note that the sweatshirt material is thinner than maybe the typical cotton with fleece lining sweatshirt you have in mind. No complaints however, it's still warm and fleece-lined like the traditional Hanes sweaters and as a girl I appreciate the thinner material since it doesn't bunch up at the shoulders and make me look boxier than normal (like some men's sweatshirts can) Perfect for spring weather and super comfy.

12,AEA5AROYRT45NCGAZTVHFPX52PZQ,True,Good Quality but Fits on the Small Side,"I normally buy Fruit of the Loom Sweat Shirts but thought I'd give this one a try when it was on sale.

The material is good quality and I like the tag-less design. I did find the Hanes Sweat Shirt is more form fitting or smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Sweat Shirt of the same size. Fruit of the Loom is looser fitting and has more arm room than the Hanes.

Overall I like this Sweatshirt however I prefer the slightly larger looser fitting Fruit of the Loom sweatshirt compared to the Hanes. I mostly use sweatshirts for layering at work, hence the looser fit.

I personally would not buy this sweatshirt again however it is good quality and if you like form fitting clothes or are on the skinnier or thinner side of the scale ... this Hanes Sweatshirt might be perfect for you.","December 17, 2019",The Tech Guy,3.0,1,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEA5AROYRT45NCGAZTVHFPX52PZQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-10-05 17:11:58.879005,2020-10-05 17:11:59.056637,Hanes Mens EcoSmart Fleece Sweatshirt Sweatshirt,4.5,,Clothing & Accessories,B01L8JJLLK,Hanes Branded Printwear,2

You get what you pay for, they're well put together. The cuffs are quite tight and it's very fitted. It fits well as a medium but when I wash it I expect it will be too small to wear after. Nice colors, the fabric is starchy but soft inside. Order a size up if you like a more comfortable, looser fit.

I've noticed that in the left cuff of these sweaters (I ordered three in different colors, same size) there's some bunched up thread or something that irritates my left wrist. It just constantly rubs and rubs on the same small spot but I can't seem to locate exactly where on the cuff the irritant is. Somewhere along the seam. It's the same in all three sweaters, and you can't push or roll up the sleeves because the cuff is too tight.","December 30, 2019",Reid Johnston,3.0,0,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3MZZXN74P4IJKDMNTFWJHV55FQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-10-05 17:11:59.957483,2020-10-05 17:12:00.221979,Hanes Mens EcoSmart Fleece Sweatshirt Sweatshirt,4.5,,Clothing & Accessories,B01L8JJLLK,Hanes Branded Printwear,2

I ordered a 5XL and I wanted this to be a comfy oversized sweater that I could curl up in and too often have I been let down to realize the sizing was not what it was supposed to be--This; however, when I opened the package, looked alright.

Sure, it took some time to not necessarily stretch, but lose its new package stiffness, I have come to find it is at least what I intended it to be.

It would have been nice if it were longer, so I could just wear it like a sweater/dress/tunic like some others here have described it worked for them, but its not really long enough for that on me and I'm a little over 5ft 6.5inches (just under 5'7).
