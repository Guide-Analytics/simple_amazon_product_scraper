0,True,Great fan that moves a lot of air!,"I am very satisfied with these fans. Though the cable may be a bit short for certain cable management depending on your case/motherboard, they are cased nicely and look good (I'm using a fractal design meshify c case/Asus ROG strix z490 e-gaming motherboard). The installation was super easy. At first I wasn't sure if the screw holes being 120mm on a 140mm fan would work, but for my set up they fit perfectly. Using the self tapping screws was also a breeze.

The fans, IMO, are nice and quiet, though I will say at full blast they move a lot of air and the noise factor comes much more into play. That being said, I have never had them go full blast while gaming or running the heaven benchmark on ultra. The black design is refreshing and the slight colour choice in the rubber pads is fun, though you don't see much of the colour once the fan is installed. Overall a great fan and I would recommend these to anyone looking for a 140mm fan.","June 16, 2020",Timothy Schmidt,5.0,One,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFRS5KMWWN72ZEJE5Y5UL6NVFFXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-08-25 13:48:53.101591,2020-08-25 13:48:53.224192,"Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.black.swap, Premium Quiet Fan, 4-Pin (140mm, Black)",4.7,15

14,True,"Good, but not *EXACTLY* the same as stock fans.","While this fan is supposed to be ""identical"" to the stock fans on the NH-D15, for example, it is manufactured in China, whereas the NH-D15 (and I'm assuming its fans) are manufactured in Tawain. The fans are indeed the same model and work perfectly as swaps for the stock fans, however, the mold quality is slightly different with its edges being slightly rougher--just slightly! This fan works perfect for a swap, I just thought I'd have to nit-pick it for something! You really have to look closely at the fan to notice this, and I doubt it impacts its performance much.","December 8, 2017",Amazon Customer,4.0,2,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHSAPEKMZY23HGZFX4CFCMZ55GLQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-08-25 13:48:57.720912,2020-08-25 13:48:57.818520,"Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.black.swap, Premium Quiet Fan, 4-Pin (140mm, Black)",4.7,15
